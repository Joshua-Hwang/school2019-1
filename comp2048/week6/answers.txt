Part 1
a)
The first example has 4 states.
q0, saw_#, saw_## and qa (also qr is implied)

The second example has 9 states.
q0, End, FindDelimiter0, FindDelimiter1, Check0, Check1, FindLeftmost, FindNext and qa. (qr)

b)
The library we're using has a neat debug feature which prints state and r/w head.

c)
First example checks for two hashes and only two hashes. Fails in all other
circumstances.

Second example checks two substrings are equal given a hash splitting them.

Part 2
See code

Part 3
b)
Since we're dealing with an infinite tape it's way better to generate
the data structure when needed instead of storing infinite space in memory

c)
Got 4 ones

d)
Comparing our result to Wikipedia we find our result is the best possible for
2 cards

e)
