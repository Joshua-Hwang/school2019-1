Note: I say broadcast IP 255.255.255.255 but that will be different in this
      assignment be vigilant of other such finds.

First question pg 371

1. client searches for DHCP server with a DHCP discover message.
   UDP sent on port 67
   destination IP 255.255.255.255
   source IP 0.0.0.0
   (This is all fine because of MAC addresses down in link layer)

2. DHCP server receives the message and sends a DHCP offer message that is
   broadcast to all nodes on the subnet using broadcast (destination) IP
   255.255.255.255. Note: there may be several DHCP servers on the subnet thus
   the client may make a discerning choice.
   Each offer messsage contains: transaction ID of previous discover message,
   proposed IP address for client, network mask of subnet and IP address lease
   time (may be hours or even days).

3. Once the client has chosen an IP from the offer messages it will send a
   DHCP request message with the same configuration parameters as the offer.

4. The DHCP server then responds to the DHCP request message with a DHCP ACK
   confirming the configuration parameters (copying the configuration sent
   from the request)

Second question pg 501
1. Host A sends an ARP packet (which has IP src and dest, MAC src and dest)
   using the broadcast MAC FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF as destination (so all in the
   subnet will listen). This packet is asking for MAC of gateway.
   The switch forwards this packet to everyone (I think that's a separate step)
   and each host checks it's own IP to confirm if it's them.
2. The gateway will then send back an ARP packet with information of itself
   and the host. The switch forwards this to the host
   (it's own ARP now knows Host A)
3. Host A sends a complete DNS packet to the gateway. Which will eventually
   reach D2 after crossing subnets.
4. I'm pretty sure R1 then removes the MAC address and adds a different one.

Third question pg 374
Should be simple... Host A to R1 then R1 to internet
Host A using 4001 and R1 is converting that into port 5001

Fourth question pg 375
In addition to the previous question, Host B is using port 3200 and R1 is
converting it into (whatever you want here)

Fifth question pg ???
(Unsure with how broadcast IP and broadcast MAC are both handled, does the
gateway R1 send that to the internet? Surely not)
Pretty sure the switch sends to D2 and R1.

Sixth question pg ???
The server sent a packet with a local IP (192.168.1.2). This IP is not present
in its subnet thus no one will get that packet. Not to mention S won't be able
to find a corresponding MAC address.

--------------------------------PART B-----------------------------------------
First question
My guess it's 169.254.169.254 for gateway? (it's not, that's a protocol thing)
My guess it's 10.240.128.1 for gateway (No. 119) and (No. 145) and (No. 381)
all have external (internet) ip addresses thus they must all pass through the
gateway which we can find the MAC address of. We then find its ARP responses
(No. 26) where it tells people its 10.240.128.1.

That is undoubtedly 10.240.129.251 (No. 20) which is sending DHCP offers.

That is undoubtedly 130.102.189.53 (No. 72) which receiving and sending DNS packets .

Second question
(No. 20) DHCP offers include subnet information.
Subnet is 255.255.254.0 so the binary rep of this is,
11111111.11111111.11111110.00000000 thus there are 9 degrees of freedom.
2^9 = 512 possible addresses.

Third question
The receiver (Target) is Dell_7c:92:fe using only the first half of the MAC
address Dell_7c

ARP requests are broadcast but this is an ARP response thus it's unicast,
sending information to a single destination.

Fourth question
Pretty sure the SFD (Start Frame Delimiter) isn't present. Not only does it
not have any useful information, but the hexdump of a packet doesn't show the
frame header so it's purely recorded by the information window.

The source MAC address is definitely present

So is the destination MAC address

Ethertype is present as well

The payload is what is actually getting sent (the hexdump) so yeah it's there.

The CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) is the check at the end of a frame. I can't
seem to find it.

Fifth question
Based on the number of pings to 130.102.181.48 that's probably what a traceroute
is. At (No. 144) we see a DNS response telling our client that learn.uq.edu.au
is at 130.102.181.48.

Sixth question
(No. 270) Is the first ping that gets a response from the server. Thus ping
had a ttl of 12. Thus it takes 12 hops to get to
learn.uq.edu.au (130.102.181.48).

Seventh question
(No. 145) this seems to be the start of the traceroute (also did not receive a
response). This frame has a ttl=1.

Eighth question
(No. 343) A DNS query gives us a little more information telling us that
lichen.labs.eait.uq.edu.au is 8.72.102.130 (the in-addr.arpa part is used in
reverse dns lookups)

Ninth question
(No. 342) the destination is 130.102.189.53.

Tenth question
Need to find the windows commands for the following
DHCP reset/flush/release

DHCP request

ping 104.16.73.45

make a DNS request
