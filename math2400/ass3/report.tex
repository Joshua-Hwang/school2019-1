\section{Show that $f$ is differntiable at 0}
\begin{align*}
    f(x)
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        x^2 & \text{$x$ is rational} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align*}

the differential exists (with respect to limits)
think we can use squeeze theorem to get the limits just right

\section{Show Lipschitz continuous iff $f'$ is bounded}
I have no idea

\section{Use lower and upper sums to show integrable}
Should be a simple application of lecture theorem

\section{Show mean value theorem of integrals}
I don't really know
might take a look at the lecture notes and modify???

\section{Show $f(x) = 0$}
Should be pretty simple as far as I'm aware

\section{Show there exists $f(c) = g(c)$}
Create a new function f(x) - g(x) = h(x). Maybe find something???

\end{document}
